# Ethiopia Economic Monitoring for Understanding Poverty Trends

## Assignment

The East Africa Poverty Team has requested support for using alternative data to better understand economic and poverty trends in Ethiopia. 

The assignment includes an analysis of urban air quality trends, crop monitoring, and an analysis of sentiment towards recent socio-poltical crises through crowd-sourced survey data and Google search trends. 




## Data

The following datasets are used in this assignmet. Further details about each dataset -- licesning, frequency of updates, access instructions, etc. -- may be found on the [Data](https://worldbank.github.io/ethiopia-economic-monitoring/docs/2-data.html) section of the project web book.

* [Copernicus Atmosphere Satellite Data](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/copernicus-services/atmosphere) - Copernicus is the Earth observation component of the European Union’s Space programme, which includes an array of data products, including atmospheric obersvations. These include: air quality and atmospheric composition; ozone layer and ultra-violet radiation; emissions and surface fluxes; solar radiation, and climate forcing. The team accesses Copernicus data through [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). 
* [Digital Earth Africa Cropland Extent Map](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/platform-resources/services/cropland-extent-map) - The service shows the presence or absence of crop for a 10-meter pixel resolution.
* [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) - NASA's 'Modern Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer' dataset, used to monitor changes in surface vegetation. 
* [Premise](https://docs.datapartnership.org/partners/premise/README.html) - A data and analytics platform that generates real-time, actionable information by combining a global network of on-the-ground contributors with data science and machine learning. Prior survey data access can be requested through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/).
* [Google Search Trends](https://docs.datapartnership.org/partners/google/README.html). A private Google service for analyzing Google seach trends at a sub-national level. API access can be requested through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/).
